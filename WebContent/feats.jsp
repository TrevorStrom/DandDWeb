					benefits.</p>
				<ul>
					<li>You gain a +1 bonus to attack rolls you make with a spear.</li>
					<li>When you use a spear, its damage die changes from a d6 to
						a d8, and from a d8 to a d10 when wielded with two hands. (This
						benefit has no effect if another feature has already improved the
						weapon’s die.)</li>
					<li>You can set your spear to receive a charge. As a bonus
						action, choose a creature you can see that is at least 20 feet
						away from you. If that creature moves within your spear’s reach on
						its next turn, you can make a melee attack against it with your
						spear as a reaction. If the attack hits, the target takes an extra
						1d8 piercing damage, or an extra 1d10 piercing damage if you wield
						the spear with two hands. You can’t use this ability if the
						creature used the Disengage action before moving.</li>
					<li>As a bonus action on your turn, you can increase your
						reach with a spear by 5 feet for the rest of your turn.</li>
